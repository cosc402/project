# C++ Visualizer

The interpreter has five components in /src:
 - *vislexer.py*: lexer
 - *visparser.py*: parser
 - *symbol.py*: defines the symbol tree class `Env`
 - *viserror.py*: defines exceptions
 - *vis.py*: driver code
 
Simply run `python vis.py` to start the interpreter. It should work
exactly as it did before in inter.py.
